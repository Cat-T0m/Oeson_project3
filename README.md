# Oeson_project3
The third project, part of the OGTIP program. The focus here is on EDA and Machine Learning models.
There are 2 Jupyter notebook files pertaining to this. Proj3.ipynb is the main one and also pertains to the presentation that I uploaded on LinkedIn.
Proj3_all_label.ipynb shows a slightly different analysis with different feature encoding and scaling (i.e. in this one StandardScaler was used instead of MinMax and all columns were label encoded).
